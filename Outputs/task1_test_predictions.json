    "reviews": "bought this at best buy since i had a $10 reward coupon so only sent $40 for this tablet. short story this tablet can do everything your smart phone can do and i kinda like amazon's new os running on this tablet better than android, nice clean interface and very user friendly also like the way categories are on top and you can swipe right to view them. as far as speed is concern this tablet is good, you can jump from apps with ease (although installing new apps are a bit slower than on android) the apps have installed are facebook,linkedin, overdrive, cnn, pandora, pinterest, skpe all run fine. you can even run games on this $50 device, games like sky force, real racing 3 (these game have high graphics) run surprisingly smooth. videos on netflix, hbo now, pluto tv and youtube look great even though they are not hd. sound is just ok (my smartphone sounds better) and the display is good compared to other cheap tablets on the market that are not ips. battery life is good too, can go a couple of days without charging with just reading books, checking facebook, surf the web and gaming. already accidentally dropped my tablet on the floor with no damage at all.i not a prime member but purchase a lot from amazon so this device is convenient when ordering books and other items. this tablet has been rock solid for the week i have it and it's still shocking to me regarding the price with no compromise in quality. was going to buy the amazon fire hd but since my last $270 amazon tablet was lost this makes more sense since it's at a price point where you can easily replace it. amazon has really changed the game with this tablet, other's reviews that state that this is only for kids or beginner tablet owner's i disagree with. now for the people who must have the best tablet on the market (looking at you apple ipad and samsung) then this is not for you, but for others who need a device to do everyday task (just like your smartphone) then this is the one don't let the cheap price fool you. you get a lot for $50",

    "reviews": "this amazon fire tablet is amazing. it's not an ipad or galaxy, but it still packs a ton of value into a nice package. you get a lot of nice features here, and not a lot of bull, as one would often expect from a device so cheap. the screen is surprisingly well made and durable. while it's not the sharpest one out there, it's not exactly blurry either at 1024 x 600 pixels. there is only a single speaker, and no sort of flashlight aside from the screen. the speaker gets to a decent volume, but i would not consider it to be loud. i took a leap of faith here in buying this and i am so very glad that i did because this tablet has far surpassed my expectations in every way. the games are smooth and fast with minimal lag from what i've seen so far. this plays demanding 3d games pretty well i may add. the amazon store has a lot of cool free things to mess with when you first start out. it only took about a half an hour or so to set up and update everything. the micro sd slot accepts up to 128gb cards. battery life is ok. if not gaming on this, you can expect 6 hours or more. with light use, this could last all day on a single charge. video is smooth and the screen is nice and surprisingly bright. the responsiveness of the screen is spot on. i can't really mention any downfall , because there really isn't any. the one thing i will say could be better it the wifi. when set to default settings, wifi kept turning off on me. once i set wifi up to be always on, it was much better. you usually get what you pay for. in this case, you get more. this unit feels like it could have easily cost well over $100. i'm just sad that i didn't yet get a protective case for mine. i would highly recommend this product to friends, family, or anyone who needs a nice tablet or wants a nice gift for someone. this amazon fire 7 inch tablet earns a solid 10 out of 10 stars from me. i'm picky too. if you are even slightly considering this, just buy it. you won't be disappointed. shock value",

    "reviews": "despite not being able to get one of these from amazon until late june due to apparent strong demand, best buy was able to get one to me on the day of its release, april 27. well done best buy! having owned several previous kindles, including the most recent paperwhite model, i was unprepared for how small and light this new oasis model is -- reading about it is one thing, but actually holding one in your hand is something else entirely. the oasis and its battery-charging cover together weigh only one ounce more than the latest paperwhite with no case. the oasis _without_ its cover feels impossibly light at 4.6 ounces. size-wise, the oasis is nearly a square shape at about 5\" wide by 5.5\" tall. in fact, the shape is so different from traditional kindle designs that i had to compare it next to my paperwhite to verify that the screens are actually the same size (they are). it's the first kindle i think i could easily fit into a jacket pocket without any effort, for frequent travelers like me, this is a key reason to buy one of these, as it's extremely compact and easy to pack in a briefcase or purse. the screen is the first front-lit kindle i've ever seen where you simply cannot see any trace of the leds from any angle. no dark spots, no bright spots...just a completely uniform illumination from edge to edge in both directions. the \"page\" also appears to be nearly flush with the top glass surface, helping achieve the illusion of printed paper. it's sharp and clear, better than any kindle i've used. the reader can be easily separated from the battery case by simply pulling them apart, since they are held together with magnets. after doing so, this is where the amazon engineering team's achievements really become clear, as you just won't believe how lightweight this thing is. it's easy to imagine holding onto it for hours without any arm fatigue, and switching from hand to hand is a simple matter of rotating it 180 degrees when switching. the display instantly rotates, and the page turn buttons also \"follow\", with the top button always used to advance the page, and the bottom button always used to go backward. you can also use the screen to change pages as you always have with earlier touch screen models. the battery on the reader has a lower capacity than the cover's battery, so it runs down faster if you don't have it connected to the case. it's very easy to snap the reader back into its cover, which allows it to recharge while you continue to read. the power button and charge port are located in the upper top-right corner, more or less opposite from where they are on the paperwhite. i find this location to be less awkward, as it's easier to reach on the top than it is on the bottom edge. the back surface of the reader (not the case) seems to easily attract fingerprints, and they are not so easy to clean off. you'd think that amazon would have figured out a way to prevent this by now. it's a minor annoyance. lots of reviewers in the tech press have complained loudly about this model's high price relative to other kindle models (without ads, it's $310 vs. $139 for an ad-less paperwhite). is this a lot of money? perhaps, but if you are a book addict and value an extremely lightweight reader that's easy on both your arms and your eyes, then i personally think it's worth it. a lot of thought and effort clearly went into designing and building this unit, and the price reflects that. is it for everyone? probably not, but there is obviously a market for it when you consider how many months you'll have to wait to get one on amazon's website. if you are a serious reader, this device deserves a very close look -- i'm definitely keeping mine! remarkably small and lightweight",

    "reviews": "i originally purchased the paper white and after a week of that, i decided to upgrade to the voyage for a couple reasons. 1) perhaps my phone has made me lazy but i've grown accustomed to auto-brightness. it's something that i don't even really think of at all... until you have to manually adjust it. the voyage is currently the only kindle that automatically adjusts the brightness of the screen. i've read reviews that question the efficacy of it, and those people tend to say it's hit or miss. i humbly submit that that is because it's a 'smart' auto-brightness that adjusts to your preferences at certain light levels. for instance if you're in a dimly lit room and the screen is too bright for you there, and you manually turn it down a few notches the next time you're in that room, the kindle will remember what your screen brightness preference was at that light level and adjust. i have had no problems with this feature and consider it the most indispensable feature on the kindle. it's brilliant.2) page turn haptic buttons. these are great, and allow me to not need to move my hand at all to turn a page, i simply squeeze. i do wish they had been placed slightly higher on the device as i find i've needed to adjust my grip lower than i normally would have held on to the device. it's very nice having the option to not need to swipe the page to turn it.3) the flush screen. this makes a big difference to me - i was not a fan of the recessed screen on the paper white and even the nook has a flush screen! amazon really needs to introduce waterproof kindles and a flush screen is going to be necessary for that. this is also my only negative about the device - the screen appears to be slightly more reflective than the paper white and i've heard (wether it's true or not) that is because the voyage has a glass screen, while the paper white has plastic? i'm not sure, but the only time i notice this is when i'm reading the the sun is directly behind me. i may need to tilt the screen 5 degrees in any direction and it's easily readable again.4) the general design is sleeker and feels better in my hand than the paper white. this also allows the device to be slightly lighter than the paper white, which is always a good thing.to recap - this is the only kindle to feature the auto-brightness feature (not even the oasis has it--probably to save on weight) and in my opinion a worthy upgrade over the paper white. worth the premium price",

    "reviews": "these days, amazon doesn't supply a charger when you purchase a new kindle. that makes sense because most kindle purchasers probably have older kindle models already, or other usb powered devices or phones or tablets, many of which will have included chargers. as a result most people will already have a sufficient supply of chargers sitting around.but for someone who wants or needs a new charger when they order a new kindle, amazon presents you with the option to buy one at the time of your kindle purchase.so i was surprised when i noticed this new charger model now being offered as an option for new kindles. my first thought was that amazon had updated their previous charger models to bring them up-to-date and make them competitive with the great variety of third party chargers now available (see links below for these earlier models).as soon as i looked at the specs for this charger though, i was disappointed. unfortunately, even though this is amazon's latest basic charger offering, it is not in my opinion the best choice for someone who needs a usb charger, for a kindle or for anything else for that matter. and that's something i wouldn't usually find myself saying, because usually amazon's accessories are reasonably priced and competitive.this is certainly a capable and functional charger, and it will work perfectly fine with any kindle device and charge it acceptably well. but here are the reasons why i feel this is not the best choice:- it will supply only 1 a output, maximum. that's sufficient for a kindle e-reader but not sufficient for many other devices. any of the fire devices, for example, will benefit from a higher output charger in order to reduce charging time.read more it's a fine charger, just be aware that there are more capable (and cheaper) chargers available",

    "reviews": "update! 11/11/15: more than a year now of using the stick literally every single evening for netflix, and it has been overall very reliable.bottom line this is the best streaming device for the dollar(in my humble opinion) it's cheap, it handles netflix/prime/hbogo/plex/games/a lot more doesn't seem much slower than the full firetv box. i started with a roku2 in the living room which got pushed to the bedroom when i got the firetv box, then the firetv stick replaced the roku2. i tried the roku stick but returned it because it was just too darn slow. i'm completely firetv now and 100 happy with it..what it does: it adds internet/streaming functionality to any tv/monitor with an hdmi port. you can use any of the thousands of paid and/or free apps such as netflix, amazon prime, hulu, plex, news, digital fireplace, etc... there's a ton you can do. with some extra effort you can sideload things like kodi and 3rd party apps. it's super simple to use, and the image quality can be great if your internet connection is fast.the good stuff...-same pricerange as the less capable/less powered chromecast roku stick-more ram/memory than the competition(keeps things running smooth)-more storage space than the competition, you can store more apps/games/etc..-you can do some gaming with it, but the firetv box is better suited-so small you can bring it pretty much anywhere with ease.-simple clean interface.-lots of games/apps to choose from-the phone app is actually pretty usefulnot as good stuff...-no connections other than usb for power, if you need ethernet/audio in/out, get the box!read more best streamer for your dollar - thoughts from a roku firetv box user 8,",

(something i never thought i'd say) one warning! it gets expensive quick. i had it two days and was already back at best buy buying a phillips hue starter kit so i could control my bedroom lights by voice. not mention that you can order using amazon prime by voice. although some setup to do so is required. as far as the overall initial configuration is very easy. the sound is very good and it makes a great blue tooth speaker as well. excellent! excellent device!",

    "reviews": "i brought a bargain tablet about a year ago and ended up very disappointed in the browsing speed. i basically wanted a tablet for quick web searches without having to boot my pc. i was nervous to try again, but am so glad i did. the amazon fire $50 tablet is awesome for quick surfing tasks. i also use the kindle e-reader app on it, and this works well too. the reason for my 4-star rating (instead of 5) is two-fold, but both are related to apps. my first issue is the yahoo email app - for some reason i don't have access to my contacts in it! i didn't realize this at first when i was just reading emails, but trying to send an email was awful... it took about a half hour because i had to dig through my inbox for emails from the people i wanted to send to so i could find their address to put in the to box of the new message i was creating. what a pain! the other issue is that the app world is dominated by \"for iphone\" and \"for android\", so you may be severely limited in what you can find for this tablet because it doesn't fit neatly into one of those two categories. however these are minor annoyances and not the primary reason why i wanted a tablet. so if you need to do quick internet searches/research or want to use the ereader, then you cannot beat this price for the quality you receive. love, love, love my new amazon fire tablet!!! awesome tablet for the price",

    "reviews": "i've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the samsung line, but this is my first amazon fire, so i want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. at the time that this was written, alexa had not been added to the tablet.first, while this device runs an android type of operating system, amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. i don't feel like i'm using android. this feels different to me. it doesn't have the same level of customization that android users have come to appreciate. that being said, if you are an amazon prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. it's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.there are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. the middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. the button to the left acts as a sort of \"back\" button. it also lets me get rid of my keyboard when i don't need it on screen, but it's open. the button to the right is super important. it took me a couple of days to realize what it does. that square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. it lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. you can close them by pressing the \"x\" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. if you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery. make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.the device has several menus that you swipe left to view. first, you start with your home screen. you literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. all of your apps are housed here. you swipe up to view all of them. the tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as slik, amazon's own internet browser, audible, good reads, the amazon app store, a weather app, etc. you can go to the amazon app store to download other apps such as twitter, facebook, etc. you can combine the apps on this page into folders. you just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. this made my home screen much more manageable. you can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. this feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. i believe it only changes the font on your main screens.if you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of \"new items.\" the device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the washington post. you'll see that under \"new items\" when you initially activate your tablet.you can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. you can do this through the settings menu on the device. if you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into amazon's photos app, which is a cloud-based app.so far, i haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. i'm not crazy about the amazon photo app. i found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into amazon's cloud just so i could view them on my tablet. that being said, i'm not planning to take photos on this device. i just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. they are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. all of those screens are connected to your amazon account. for example, if you have kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the books menu. your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. there doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. that bugs me, but it's not the end of the world. there's also one menu to the left of the \"home\" menu. it's the \"recent\" page. it shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. i never use it, but it might be handy for some people.one of my favorite features of this tablet is amazon's \"on deck\" capability. if you're an amazon prime member, amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. the items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. you can turn off the \"on deck\" feature if you don't like it. i've been content with the video playback capability. this isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is ok. i'll talk more about the speakers later. my other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the newstand. i've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. now, i can always have my magazines with me so if i'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, i always have them. one of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. i just had to connect my account to the device. this allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as i've had an account. my other magazine didn't include a digital edition so i canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (it was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) there are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. i did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.the kindle fire doesn't come with the google play store installed. you can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) you can google to find the instructions to do this. it's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. it probably took me 10 minutes. most of the apps i wanted were in the amazon store, but there were a handful that i had paid for through google play. the only way i could have them was to go back to access that store. they have worked fine so far. i despise the keyboard that amazon pre-installed on this device. there are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. i suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but i hate it. i fixed that problem by going to google play and downloading a new keyboard. it was a pretty easy problem to solve so i can't complain.apps that are connecting to the internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. if you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. the screen on this device isn't bad. if i compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.the speakers are ok. there are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. i won't say that they are fantastic. they aren't. in my opinion, they are fine for watching youtube or a television show. they are not ok for listening to music if you are an audiophile. you can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. that being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.this device wasn't made for taking pictures. it has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. i'm not using them.i find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. i think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. also, i do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has carpal tunnel syndrome). i think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. i'm still waiting for it. i'm greatly enjoying this device. it's simply fun to use the tablet. there are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use amazon services. if you don't typically use amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be ok for you. great price on an awesome little tablet",

    "reviews": "i really enjoy the echo. i got an echo dot and liked it so much i then got the full size echo. i originally go the echo dot for the novelty thinking i wouldn't really use it very much but it turns out that i use them all the time. it is not something that anyone really needs but it is handy and a lot of fun. some of the things it does really well: it's great at voice recognition - you seldom have to repeat yourself. setting timers, reminders, and alarms is as easy as saying alexa, wake me at 7 am or alexa, tell me when 10 minutes is up. if you are a prime member the echo is great at playing music from your music library or from prime music. it's also great at playing radio stations (using tune-in and other apps). in the morning i'll say alexa, play 680 wrko to listen to kim and vb on the radio. some of the things the echo is bad at: it's well known that it uses microsoft's bing search engine so most anything the echo has to search for comes back with the response i don't know that. being able to tell the echo to use yahoo or google would make this a five star rating. also, if you set an alarm or reminder it only reminds you on the device you specify or the one that hears you. for example, if i'm in the upstairs bedroom (location of the echo dot) and say remind me to call john smith in 10 minutes and then i go downstairs to the kitchen (location of the echo), the reminder will only be in the bedroom. it would be nice if i could have an alarm or reminder set on both devices. the echo dot has the same capability as the full size echo as far as i can tell. the only difference is the full size echo has much better sound for music. that being said, the echo dot still sounds great, amazing really, for such a small device. but the full size echo is like listening to a stereo. again, these are well-made devices and are a lot of fun and very useful. maybe not a necessity but they sure are a fun conversation piece with guests or grandkids come around. a lot of fun, well made, versatile, and very useful",
